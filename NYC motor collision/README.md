## Introduction

The purpose of this research is to determine what factors might lead to an accident in New York city.   In our research we had a lot of various variables that 
provided information, such as: 
- how an accident occurred
- what time the accident took place
- when it happened
and some other important parts of the accidents.  The data was easily wrangled in order to perform our analysis due to the collection and distribution of the data by the New York city database.  The dataset was pulled from:

```
[New York City Open data] (http://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95) website.  
```

The data is constantly updated with the most recent information from the previous day.  For our data we used the data that was from before November 25, 2017 and after January 1, 2013.

The analysis we were able to do on the data mainly relied on the columns that had the data about the causes of the accidents, the time data for each of the 
accidents, and where the accidents took place.   With this data we were able to determine that factors such as pedestrian confusion and unsafe speed could lead 
to a higher risk of death or injury.    

## Ethical Consideration

Stakeholders in our data analysis include a wide arrange of people. The New York City Government and NYPD might want to know which areas of the city are more 
dangerous and have the most accidents so that they can attempt to change the layout of traffic in that area or have police units prepared to stop or respond to 
an accident quickly in those areas. Tourists also may be interested in knowing which areas to try and avoid driving through or touring around since there is an 
increase in accidents at varying locations. We followed all of the rules when it comes to ethical research. The dataset is a public dataset that is shared by the 
NYPD so there is consent and respect for anonymity. There was no harm done by the collectors of the data. Vulnerable groups of  people are not affected or taken 
advantage of by the recording of this data. Overall, our analysis does not have any ethical concerns since all ethical guidelines were met.
