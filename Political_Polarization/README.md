## Introduction: Polarization in congress: Assumptions vs Analysis

Polarization in Congress is not new, but depending on where you start counting polarization among members of the two parties in Congress has increased at an explosive rate since the 1940s and shows no signs of slowing down. Media coverage and scholarly analysis of this phenomenon, while abundant, lacks consensus as to the causes and consequences of polarization. To be sure, this is a complicated puzzle, but one which is deserving of continued attention and data driven analysis. In this project we will utilize a greatly expanded universe of data and measures to drill deeper into congressional polarization. We will use skills with a particular focus on using polished visuals and especially regression models to evaluate claims related to polarization. 

## Objective
To investigate the correlates and causes of polarization since World War II. 
Objective is to produce a report that can be distributed to members of congress, their staff, and interested constituents. This report should be professional, accessible, data driven with visuals and statistical analysis, and polished so that it is ready for consumption (i.e., no code, polished prose, good visuals, solid formatting, and appropriate analysis). Your team has been working on collecting readily available data that might be of value and has provided you with single data file, a rough codebook, and "preliminaries" section (see below) that will help you review, extend, and become familiar with the data and relevant techniques that the members of congress identified as appropriate for the report's audience.
